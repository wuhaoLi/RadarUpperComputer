Used for height measurement, corresponding to the official experiment "level_densing" of TI;

This is a modified version of the code created by ibaiGorordo (https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/IWR1443-Read-Data-Python-MMWAVE-SDK-1/blob/master/readData_IWR1443.py) to read data from the IWR1443 and kirkster96 (https://github.com/kirkster96/IWR6843-Read-Data-Python-MMWAVE-SDK) 

I corrected the errors in the first two based on the “mmw_HighAccu.js”, which is the source code of the visualization window of ti.
